# pisend 2.40 for core 3.01.10
pisend betas

I would highly recommend you test out 2mb, run the test2mb.bas and this will temporarily set your pi0 to 2,000,000. If you have any issues you can power cycle the Next to get back to 115,200. When you are happy you can use pisend to permanently set the higher speed. 

Enjoy, em00k

pisend usage
```
.pisend -q 

 tests for NextPi, first 115,200 then 2Mbit, sets ref $7f to 2 or 8 respectively, 0 on fail
 
.pisend {filename}

 base64 encodes the selected file and sends in chunks to NextPi
 
.pisend -s {string}

 sends keys to NextPi console (useful for controlling running apps like ModPi)
 
.pisend -r to empty 512 bytes to $c000 fron the uart buffer
 
 You must .pisend -q before .pisend -U as this will set an internal register.
 
.pisend -U 
 ** WARNING THIS COULD STOP NEXTPI FROM BOOTING **
 swaps baud rate of NextPi between 115,200 and 2Mbit, reboots the pi. Use .term to check progress

I HIGHLY recommend you now use 2mbit unles you have an issue. There is a try2mb.bas file in the pisend folder that will let you TEST the faster speeds - you can revert by doing a power cycle. Everything is better at 2mb!

  - visusliser crashes randomly, recommend a reset for now.
